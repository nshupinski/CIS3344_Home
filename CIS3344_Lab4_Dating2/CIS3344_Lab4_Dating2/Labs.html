                    Prior to this assignment I have never touched HTML or CSS.
                    <br />Some of the CSS techniques that I applied to this projct from what I learned in class were things life floating, working with the box model,
                    <br />This project was surprisingly a lot of fun for me because it was my first introduction to styling with code. I think what was good about this project was
                    how open it was to do what we wanted which allowed it to stay relatively easy for a beginner like me. Don't get me wrong, as being my first time ever touching
                    HTML or CSS it gave me more than enough headaches, but at the same time was a great way for me to learn. I think for me because I had never done anything like this
                    before it would have been nice to maybe have a little bit of a smaller project to allow me to make more mistakes and work to fix them rather than to have to
                    try something else because of time restraints but I also feel like I had more trouble with this than the average student did.
                    <br />Overall, a challenge for sure to learn the basics of it all, but a great start to the class.

                <p>
                    I learned about making my website more adaptive and flexible to the user's device size and how to display it
                    it different ways depending on that size (media queres). I also learned a lot of little things along the way like
                    how I got a much better idea for how to use the block display and anchor tags. A big challenge for me on this one
                    was definitely how to work with tables. The HTML of it isn't hard at all but styling them with form controls
                    was certainly a challenge. Using the form controls was fun and easier than expected, but again, styling them
                    served as an issue.

                <p>
                    I learned a great deal from this project. I used javascript for the first time and was forced
                    to become very familiar with it but in dynamically creating elements but styling them too. I also
                    learned how to create and work with javascript objects, like the profiles I made.
                    I liked making a website that was dynamic and realistically flexable. The fact that it was so open-
                    ended allowed me to have a lot of fun with my selected theme. What I did not like, however, was how
                    obnoxiously tedious and long this project was. The unnecessarily large amount of profiles that took
                    many hours to create was very frustrating and frankly, took away from the project. Not only that, but
                    the project as a whole was very large and took me many, many hours to complete. I am proud of the
                    project I have created but am not happy about the literal days it took to create.

                <p>
                    This lab was very frustrating to me because I put a very large amount of time into it and hit
                    many unnecessary bumps while making it. What I did like was that it made a previous project more
                    realistic by adding useful features to it. I learned a lot about local storage because
                    realistically, that is what this project was about. I did have a good amount of trouble with
                    local storage though because with the many new pages involved, it got pretty complicated. I did
                    find this project, however, to be very javascript heavy at all because many of the features
                    could be reused from the first project. All in all, I wish I could have had more time with this
                    project to make it smoother, but being able to use local storage was a very useful tool to
                    work with.

                <p>
                    This project turned out to be a lot of fun because of my project partner, selected framework, and website concept. All things came 
                    together very nicely. Bulma was a great framework to learn and will definitely be in my future projects. I also learned a great
                    deal more about using a database and an API. Having a partner, in my case, made this project even better because I had 
                    someone to help plan the website with and someone to ask for help. I enjoyed how open-ended this project was but the only thing 
                    I disliked about this project was that it did not take the place of a lab. Just adding this on top of the class workload made it very
                    difficult to manage and honestly, greatly took away from how much I was able to accomplish.

                <p>
                    I was actually pretty excited for this lab because I found how proud I become of the things I complete in this
                    class and this lab would finalize the website I have been working on for so long. Working with databases and APIs
                    were not as difficult as I had expected but they did provide many annoying errors in the beginning when my syntax
                    knowledge was weaker. I much prefer to work with them now though over only using local storage. I put a very large
                    amount of time and effort into this project but unfortunately was held down by stupid little syntax mistakes that
                    ultimately took up too much of my time. This lab appeared at first to be very very large but after working on it
                    for a bit, it became a <u>little</u> less daunting. I am proud of what I've accomplished and have created.
