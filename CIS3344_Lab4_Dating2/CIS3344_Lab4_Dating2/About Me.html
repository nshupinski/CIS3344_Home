                    I've been a gamer since I was a wee lad and my passion has never faded. I love to play video games and have recently become a huge fan of the e-sports Philadelphia
                    Fusion Overwatch League team. I was lucky enough to get tickets to see the 2019 Overwatch Grand Finals here in Philadelphia and had an absolute blast.

                <p>
                    One of my passions is rock climbing. I've always been a monkey but since joining the Temple Rock Climbing Club I've realized how big a part of my life
                    climbing can be and how happy it makes me.

                    Fun story: My best friends are my current roommates and we met in our Temple dorm building. Because we were neighbors and the rooms had that weird hotel-like
                    door in between the rooms, my roommate decided that it was silly to knock on our neighbors' door all the time to go over so he lock picked the door
                    dividing our rooms. Thus began our friendship and thus went personal privacy forever. The End.
