                    This chess board is a remake of one of my earliest renders. About two years after making the original I decided to make it look better since my
                    skills in 3D modeling had improved. Though not my best work ever, this chess board was a lot of fun to make and design and stands as one of my favorite projects.

                    The kitchen depicted in this render was actually designed by my mom, as well as the rest of the house that isn't visible in the picture. Her dream of designing
                    her own house gave me the idea to show her, as best I could, what it could look like in real life. The focus of this project was attention to detail and 
                    though it isn't yet finished, I am very proud of what I've done.

                    This render is one that I am very proud of because of the time that I put into it. This is my first college dorm room modeled almost to scale with items from
                    both myself and my roomate in it. I ran into a lot of problems with this render because this was meant to test my skills and to force myself to grow as a 3D
                    artist. I learned a lot and came out with possibly my favorite project.

                    This is one of my more current finished projects and the result of an attempted style change. I typically work on photorealism but for this render I tried
                    an abstract piece. This project went surprisingly smoothly and took very little time. Despite that, I am very proud of my first attempt at trying something new and
                    because of it will most likely continue with this type of style.
